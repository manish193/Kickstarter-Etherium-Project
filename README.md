# Crowdfunding Etherium based project 

### About
It is a blockchain version of **kickstarter** which allows users to post campaigns with idea and required ether and will become **manager**. Other users can contribute to this campaign by donating some minumum ether and become the **approvers** of this campaign. 
If manager wants to transfer some donated ether to some third party then he/she will have to open a request and majority of approvers have to approve the request which is an advantage over kickstarter.
